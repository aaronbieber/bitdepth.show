Bit Depth is a conversation about the *intersection* of art and
technology. Your hosts, Aaron Bieber and Chris Blake, are digital artists,
photographers, and technologists with decades of work experience in software and
hardware.

Together, we explore how technology influences art, and vice-versa. Topics will
range from the impact of Instagram on fine art photography to how the NFT crazy
fueled interest in "generative" art and what that means for creators
everywhere.

Episodes will be posted soon, so keep an eye out in your favorite podcast apps.
